# 🚀 Azure Data Factory POC Projects

Welcome to my **Azure Data Factory (ADF) Proof of Concept (POC) Projects** repository!  
This repo contains a collection of beginner-friendly and practical projects that demonstrate how to use ADF for **data ingestion, transformation, and orchestration** in real-world scenarios.  

---

## 📌 Objectives of This Repository
- Showcase hands-on POC projects built using **Azure Data Factory**.  
- Learn the fundamentals of **ETL/ELT pipelines** on Azure.  
- Work with **containers, datasets, linked services, and activities** in ADF.  
- Demonstrate how raw data can be moved, processed, and prepared for **analytics & reporting**.

## 📂 Project List

### 1️⃣ Healthcare Data Copy (ADF Basics)
- **Goal:** Copy multiple healthcare CSV files from a `raw_files` container to a `processed_files` container.  
- **ADF Activities Used:** Copy Activity, Linked Service, Dataset.  
- **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Working with **wildcard file paths** to copy multiple files.  
  - Organizing data into **source & destination containers**.  
  - Taking screenshots at each step to document the workflow.  
- **Output:** A set of processed healthcare CSV files ready for further analysis or Power BI dashboards.  
- 📸 Screenshots included in the project folder.

## 📊 Why These Projects?
These projects are designed as **Proof of Concept (POC)** tasks for:
- Showcasing my learning journey in **Azure Data Engineering**.  
- Practicing concepts like **pipelines, linked services, datasets, containers**.  
- Building a **portfolio of ADF projects** that can be demonstrated during interviews.
